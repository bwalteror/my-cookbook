    <h2>A Tribute to Fern Walter</h2>
    <p>
        This digital cookbook is a loving tribute to my mother, Fern. She was an amazing cook whose greatest joy was bringing family and friends together around the dinner table. Her original recipe box, filled with handwritten cards stained with vanilla and butter, is the inspiration for this project. Each recipe here holds a memory, a story, and a whole lot of love.
    </p>
    <p>
        I built this collection to preserve her legacy and make it easy for our family, and now you, to recreate the dishes that defined our celebrations and comforted our quiet evenings.
